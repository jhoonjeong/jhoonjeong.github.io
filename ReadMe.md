Who am I? I am a Data Scientist. I am looking for a job which I can utilize my ability.
I studied theoretical physics and related mathematics. 

As a former theoretical physicist, I have a very strong background advanced-level mathematical subjects,
such as differential geometry, abstract algebra, topology, and field theory. My academic research focused
on developing modified general relativity models and finding gravitational solutions of superstring theory.
I have extensive experience with lagrangian optimization. Specifically, solving differential equations of
tensors and spinors in 10 and 11 dimensions is one of my mathematical skills. For analytic calculation, I
aggressively used Mathematica as rule based programming language to overcome notoriously lengthy
computation.

With my recent interests, I have learned python and tensorflow as tools for manipulating data and
implementing basic algorithms of machine learning. To improve my coding skill, I probabilistically
modeled the 2D galaxy profile in Bayesian Inference using big astronomical data. I also developed a
unicycle simulation with two torque driven wheels using pybullet and successfully implemented
reinforcement learning algorithms to balance the unicycle.
